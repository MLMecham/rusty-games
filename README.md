## Welcome to Rusty-Games!


This project was designed to help us learn the wonderful language rust. 


### What you will find

1. A fully functional connection to a mongodb database that updates in real time. This allows users to create accounts, log in, and save the points they earn from games.

2. A working hangman game that uses ninja API to randomly select a word. This function also takes advantage of rusts robust error handling to provide a word from our word bank should the API be down.

3. A GUI made to make the game more interactable.


### Things that will be added in the future.

1. A remote server so that the game can be played from anywhere with an internet connection. The issue right now is that mongodb requires that the device running the code have its IP stored in settings, meaning that if anybody wishes to play, they must be a mongodb admin. That is kind of worrying.

2. Some games that we will add in the future include: A four player backjack, Minesweeper, Snake, Tetris, and battleship.
